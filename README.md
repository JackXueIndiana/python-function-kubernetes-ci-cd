python-function-kubernetes-ci-cd
This repo shows a http_trigger in python deployed as Azure Function in Azure App Service and containerized and deployed in Azure Kubernetes Service through Azure DevOps pipelines. There are two parts in the demo. We first create a python function and run it locally and then in Azure. Afterward, we containerize the function and test it locally and then push the image to Azure and run the image in AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). The deployment are done first manually and then with CI/CD pipeline in ADO (Azure DevOps).
